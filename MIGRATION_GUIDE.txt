# Database Migration Guide for ScreenCast Application

   pip install Flask-Migrate


Migration Steps

1. Initialize migrations (First time only):

   cd backend
   
   flask db init   ---> This creates a 'migrations' directory in your project.

2. Create a new migration:

   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"

   This generates a new migration script in migrations/versions/

3. Apply the migration:

   flask db upgrade
   
   This applies all pending migrations to your database.



$env:FLASK_APP="manage.py"

flask db migrate -m "Describe your change"

flask db upgrade
